Guid Generator for Visual Studio
========

A Visual Studio extension for quickly creating simple Guid values into your clipboard. Currently supported on Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013. It automatically puts a Guid into your clipboard when invoked, but you can turn that off.

After installation you can find the tool in the __Tools__ menu:

Or you can bind a key to it in the __Keyboard Bindings__ settings. Personally I prefer to use Ctrl+G Ctrl+G:
